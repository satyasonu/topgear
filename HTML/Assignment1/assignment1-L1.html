        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags
        such as surround and provide information about document text and may
        include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
        tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML elements
